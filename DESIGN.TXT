PROBLEM 2

Read in data using buffered reader wrapped around file reader
Each line in the file will be read in as a string, which will then be split 
a comma as the CSV file specifies
Each of the strings resulting from the split will be assigned to the 
corresponding instance variable of a Country object. 
This Country object is then stored in a list (ArrayList).

(a)
A country object will implement the Comparable interface (for the population)
in the 

Country
int population()
int name()
boolean equals(Country)
int compareTo(Country)

The CountryAnalysis class will consist of static methods to analyse the countries.
Its member variable will be an ArrayList of Country objects.
This ArrayList will be sorted using the Collections.sort() method which runs in 
nlog(n) time. 'Cos it uses merge sort (fast and stable in contrast with quick sort)


(b)


(c)
